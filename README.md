# nft-from-scratch
This AdvancedCollectible contract has been created from following the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p36tXHX1JD8&amp;t=11s tutorial.

The tutorial uses brownie / python to set-up the scripts to deploy, but I have implemented tests with hardhat / node js and deploy scripts with node js as well. I also used version 0.8.10 of the solidity compiler instead of the 0.6.x that was used in the tutorial. I deployed the contract to Mumbai testnet instead of Rinkeby.
